# **🚀 Automated News & Media Platform - Master Document**  
_Last updated: 2025-03-08_

## **📌 High-Level Concept & Vision**
### **Project Overview**
The Automated News & Media Platform is a **censorship-resistant content platform** that fetches news articles, enhances them using AI, and distributes them across multiple channels. The platform is designed to:  

✔ **Automate news aggregation** from various sources  
✔ **Ensure content integrity & immutability** using **BSV blockchain**  
✔ **Enable AI-driven content enhancement** for unique article generation  
✔ **Support multi-channel publishing** (web, social, APIs, email)  
✔ **Use blockchain-based monetization** via micropayments and licensing  

Unlike traditional media platforms, this system **stores articles permanently on BSV** for censorship resistance, while also allowing users to **earn revenue via micropayments**.

## **🛠 Technology Stack**
### **Backend**
- **FastAPI** – Lightweight, fast, and scalable API framework  
- **PostgreSQL** – Structured database for managing articles  
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for efficient data operations  
- **BeautifulSoup & Requests** – Web scraping for article extraction  
- **BSV (Bitcoin SV)** – Blockchain layer for **censorship resistance** and **micropayments**  

### **Frontend**
- **React.js** – JavaScript-based frontend for the user interface  
- **Vite** – Frontend development bundler for fast performance  
- **Axios** – Handles API requests  
- **TailwindCSS / Material UI** – UI styling  

### **Blockchain Integration (BSV)**
- **Direct On-Chain Storage** – Articles stored permanently on BSV  
- **Micropayments** – Users pay per article or tip using BSV  
- **Smart Contracts** – Automates content licensing and revenue distribution  

### **Infrastructure**
- **Docker (Planned)** – For containerization and easy deployment  
- **AWS / VPS Hosting (Planned)** – Scalable cloud hosting  
- **GitHub** – Version control

## **🔄 Data Flow & Process**
1️⃣ **Fetch articles from RSS feeds (`scraper.py`)**  
2️⃣ **Extract full content from article URLs (`extract_article.py`)**  
3️⃣ **AI-enhanced rewriting of content (`rewrite_ai.py`)**  
4️⃣ **Store structured articles in PostgreSQL (`models.py`)**  
5️⃣ **Publish full article on BSV (`blockchain.py`)**  
6️⃣ **Expose API for frontend & third-party integrations (`api.py`)**  
7️⃣ **Fetch and display content in React frontend (`services/api.js`)**  
8️⃣ **Allow users to pay per article or tip using BSV micropayments**

## **🛡️ Blockchain Integration for Censorship Resistance (Using BSV)**
### **Why Use BSV?**
✔ **Censorship Resistance** – Articles are permanently stored on-chain  
✔ **Scalability** – Handles high transaction volumes with ultra-low fees  
✔ **Direct On-Chain Storage** – No need for IPFS or third-party hosting  
✔ **Built-in Monetization** – Supports micropayments, tipping, and licensing  

### **How Blockchain is Used in the Platform**
1️⃣ **Full Article Storage On-Chain**  
   - **Articles are stored as BSV transactions**, making them **permanent**.  
   - Each article gets a **BSV transaction ID (TXID)**, which serves as a permanent link.  
   - Readers, publishers, and developers can verify articles via the TXID.  

2️⃣ **On-Chain Proof of Publication**  
   - Each article’s **hash and metadata** are stored on **BSV** before publication.  
   - Prevents stealth edits by maintaining an immutable record of all changes.  

3️⃣ **Micropayments & Monetization**  
   - Users can **pay-per-article** using **BSV micropayments** (fractions of a cent).  
   - Alternative revenue models: **tipping, premium subscriptions, and smart contract licensing**.  
   - Payments are **automated via smart contracts** for instant, transparent revenue distribution.  

4️⃣ **Smart Contract-Based Content Licensing**  
   - **AI-enhanced articles can be licensed via smart contracts**.  
   - Media outlets and third parties can **pay automatically for syndicated content**.  

5️⃣ **Decentralized Identity for Journalists (Planned Upgrade)**  
   - Verified contributors can **cryptographically sign articles** to prove authorship.  
   - Prevents impersonation and deepfake-generated fake news.
